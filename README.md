# Code for the DS blog
Description: code walkthroughs that are used in my personal [data science blog](https://michaelberk.medium.com/). The blog looks to bring academic research to the DS industry. If you have any comments/questions/ideas, feel free to reach out [here](https://michaeldberk.com/contact). Also use any code here if you'd like

## Files
- **22_time_series_cleaning_and_clustering.py**: walkthrough of how to perform feature based clustering on time series data. There are also resources linked in the file for distance-based clustering using DTW. 
- **28_prophet_vs_neural_prophet.py**: comparison between Facebook's Prohpet and NeuralProphet packages on energy consumption data in California.
- **32_freaai_potential_implementation.py**: potential implementation of IBM's FreaAI for finding weak data slices for a binary classifier. This project has lots of potential, but the code is not very usable as of now.
